    purge)
  - Do not show secrets in logs anymore
  - If available, show backtraces when a bug occurs

v0.4.0
------

  - Allow to filter Wi-SUN nodes. Mainly used to simulation specific network
    topologies
  - Allow to retrieve GAKs from DBus interface
  - Add DBus events when GTKs and GAKs are modifed
  - Fix build error if libsystemd is not available
  - Also copy documentation during install process

v0.3.1

  - File "CHANGES" has been added in branch v0.2, but not in main branch.

v0.3.0
------

  - Add DBus interface
  - Allow to change Tx power
  - Allow to set UART device from configuration file
  - Allow to set PAN ID
  - Allow to change parameters relative to GTK lifetime
  - Allow to change dwell delays
  - Fix bug with frames > 1200 bytes
  - Fix error when prefix_storage did not end with '/'
  - Drop references to SPI bus since it is not yet implemented

v0.2.1
------

  - v0.2.0 broke IPv6 routing

v0.2.0

    parameter.
  - Add parameter "tun_autoconf" to automatically configure the IP of the tun
    interface seen by Linux.
  - Command line now accepts any parameter accepted in configuration file
    through "-o KEY=VAL".

    /var/lib/wsbrd)
  - Allow to configure location (and file prefix) of the non volatile data
  - Allow to set initial GTKs
  - Add list of valid domain/mode/class combinations in documentation
  - Fix possible crash on 32bits hosts
  - Remove some traces
  - Provide a better error message if RCP firmware < 0.0.3 replies

v0.1.2
